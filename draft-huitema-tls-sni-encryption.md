.# Abstract

This draft describes a technique for doing SNI encryption that just
requires (re)adding EncryptedExtensions to the client's first flight
defining an extension that indicates "tunnelled TLS" and (maybe) a new
TLS content type. We would only tunnel the first flight and everything
else would be handed off to the hidden service. This seems like the
minimal change to enable Encrypted SNI while retaining our existing
analytical frame for the rest of TLS.

# Introduction

Historically, adversaries have been able to monitor the use of web
services through three channels: looking at DNS requests, looking at
IP addresses in packet headers, and looking at the data stream between
user and services. These channels are getting progressivley closed.
A growing fraction of
Internet communication is encrypted, mostly using Transport Layer Security
(TLS) [@?RFC5246].
Progressive deployment of solutions like DNS in
TLS [@?RFC7858] mitigates the disclosure of DNS information. More and
more services are colocated on multiplexed servers, loosening the
relation between IP address and web service. However, multiplexed servers
rely on the Service Name Information (SNI) to direct TLS connections
to the appropriate service implementation. This protocol element
is transmitted in clear text. As the other methods of monitoring get
blocked, monitoring focuses on the clear text SNI. The purpose
of SNI encryption is to prevent that.

In the past, there have been multiple attempts at defining SNI encryption.
These attempts have generally floundered, because the simple designs fail
to mitigate several of the attacks listed in (#snisecreq).

The proposed design hides a "Hidden Service" behind a "Fronting
Service". To an external observer, the TLS connections will appear to
be directed towards the Fronting Service. The cleartext SNI parameter
will document the Fronting Service. A second SNI parameter will be
transmitted in an encrypted form to the Fronting Service, and will
allow that service to redirect the connection towards the Hidden Service.

The design relies on two main components: tunneling TLS in TLS, as
explained in (#tlsintls), and obtaining Combined Tickets that enable
the tunneled connections between Client and Hidden Service through
the fronting service, as explained in (#comboticket). These two
components are conceived as extensions to TLS 1.3 [@!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].

## Key Words

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [@!RFC2119].

# Security and Privacy Requirements for SNI Encryption {#snisecreq}

Over the past years, there have been multiple proposals to add an SNI encryption
option in TLS. Many of these proposals appeared promising, but were rejected
after security reviews pointed plausible attacks. In this section,
we collect a list of these known attacks.

## Mitigate Replay Attacks {#replayattack}

The simplest SNI encryption designs replace in the initial TLS exchange the clear text SNI with
an encrypted value, using a key known to the multiplexed server. Regardless of the
encryption used, these designs can be broken by a simple replay attack, which works as follow:

1- The user starts a TLS connection to the multiplexed server, including an encrypted
   SNI value.

2- The adversary observes the exchange and copies the encrypted SNI parameter.

3- The adversary starts its own connection to the multiplexed server, including in its
   connection parameters the encrypted SNI copied from the observed exchange.

4- The multiplexed server establishes the connection to the protected service, thus
   revealing the identity of the service.

SNI encryption designs MUST mitigate this attack.

## Avoid Widely Shared Secrets {#sharedsecrets}

It is easy to think of simple schemes in which the SNI is encrypted or hashed using a
shared secret. This symmetric key must be known by the multiplexed server, and by
every users of the protected services. Such schemes are thus very fragile, since the
compromise of a single user would compromise the entire set of users and protected
services.

SNI encryption designs MUST NOT rely on widely shared secrets.

## Prevent SNI-based Denial of Service Attacks {#serveroverload}

Encrypting the SNI may create extra load for the multiplexed server. Adversaries may mount
denial of service attacks by generating random encrypted SNI values and forcing the
multiplexed server to spend resources in useless decryption attempts.

It may be argued that this is not an important DOS avenue, as regular TLS connection
attempts also require the server to perform a number of cryptographic operations. However,
in many cases, the SNI decryption will have to be performed by a front end component
with limited resources, while the TLS operations are performed by the component dedicated
to their respective services. SNI based DOS attacks could target the front end component.

SNI encryption designs MUST mitigate the risk of denial of service attacks through
forced SNI decryption.

## Do not stick out {#snireqdontstickout}

In some designs, handshakes using SNI encryption can be easily differentiated from
"regular" handshakes. For example, some designs require specific extensions in
the Client Hello packets, or specific values of the clear text SNI parameter.
If adversaries can easily detect the use of SNI encryption,
they could block it, or they could flag the users of SNI encryption for
special treatment.

In the future, it might be possible to assume that a large fraction of TLS handshakes
use SNI encryption. If that was the case, the detection of SNI encryption would
be a lesser concern. However, we have to assume that in the near future, only
a small fraction of TLS connections will use SNI encryption.

SNI encryption designs MUST minimize the observable differences between the TLS
handshakes that use SNI encryption and those that don't.

## Forward Secrecy

The general concerns about forward secrecy apply to SNI encryption just as well as
to regular TLS sessions. For example, some proposed designs rely on a public key of
the multiplexed server to define the SNI encryption key. If the corresponding
public key was compromised, the adversaries would be able to process
archival records of past connections, and retrieve the protected SNI used in
these connections. These designs failed to maintain forward secrecy of SNI
encryption.

SNI encryption designs MUST provide forward secrecy for the protected SNI.

## Proper Security Context {#nocontextsharing}

We can design solutions in which the multiplexed server or a fronting
service act as a relay to reach the protected service. Some of those
solutions involve just one TLS handshake between the client and the
multiplexed server, or between the client and the fronting service.
The master secret is verified by verifying a certificate provided by
either of these entities, but not by the protected service.

These solutions expose the client to a Man-In-The-Middle attack by
the multiplexed server or by the fronting service. Even if the client
has some reasonable trust in these services, the possibility of
MITM attack is troubling.

The multiplexed server or the fronting services could be pressured
by adversaries. By design, they could be forced to deny access to
the protected service, or to divulge which client accessed it. But
if MITM is possible, the adversaries would also be able to pressure
them into intercepting or spoofing the communications between
client and protected service.

SNI encryption designs MUST ensure that the master secret are negotiated
and verified "end to end", between client and protected service.



# SNI Encapsulation Specification

We propose to provide SNI Privacy by using a form of TLS encapsulation.
The big advantage of this design compared to previous attempts
is that it requires effectively no changes
to TLS 1.3. It only requires a way to signal to the Gateway
server that the encrypted application data is actually a ClientHello
which is intended for the hidden service. We achieve that through
the use of a special session resumption ticket, described
in (#comboticket). The Fronting Service will see a session
resumption attempt, in which the session context points
to a tunnelled session towards the Hidden Service. Once the
tunneled session is established, encrypted packets will
be forwarded to the Hidden Service without requiring
encryption or decryption by the Fronting Service.


## Tunneling TLS in TLS {#tlsintls}


The proposed design is to encapsulate a second Client Hello in the
early data of a TLS connection to the Fronting Service. To the outside,
it just appears that the client is resuming a session with the
fronting service.

                                                     + key_share*
                                            {EncryptedExtensions}
                                            {CertificateRequest*}
                                                   {Certificate*}
                                             {CertificateVerify*}
                                                       {Finished}
                     <------------------------

{CertificateVerify*}

Key to brackets:

  () encrypted with Client->Fronting 0-RTT key
  {} encrypted with Client->Hidden 1-RTT handshake
  [] encrypted with Client->Hidden 1-RTT key
~~~

The way this works is that the Gateway decrypts the *data* in the
client's first flight, which is actually ClientHello#2 from the
client, containing the true SNI and then passes it on to the Hidden
server. However, the Hidden server responds with its own ServerHello
which the Gateway just passes unchanged, because it's actually the
response to ClientHello#2 rather than to ClientHello#1. As long as
ClientHello#1 and ClientHello#2 are similar (e.g., differing only in
the client's actual share (though of course it must be in the same
group)), SNI, and maybe EarlyDataIndication), then an attacker should
not be able to distinguish these cases.

Notes on several obvious technical issues:

1. How does the Gateway distinguish this case from where the initial
   flight is actual application data? See below for some thoughts
   on this.

2. Can we make this work with 0-RTT data from the client to the Hidden
   server? I believe the answer here is "yes", because the server's
   EarlyDataIndication does not carry the configuration_id. I just
   didn't show it in the diagram because it was already getting
   complicated.

3. What happens if the Gateway server doesn't gateway, e.g., because
   it has forgotten the ServerConfiguration? In that case, the
   client gets a handshake with the Gateway, which it will have
   to determine via trial decryption. At this point the Gateway
   supplies a ServerConfiguration and the client can reconnect
   as above.

4. What happens if the client does 0-RTT inside 0-RTT (as in #2 above)
   and the Hidden server doesn't recognize the ServerConfiguration in
   ClientHello#2? In this case, the client gets a 0-RTT rejection and
   it needs to do trial decryption to know whether the rejection was
   from the Gateway or the Hidden server.

These issues will be addressed in the next edit.

## Combined Tickets {#comboticket}

The establishment of the connection relies on "combined tickets". In
a regular TLS 1.3 session, the client obtains resumption tickets
from the server
after completion of the handshake. This is also the case here, but
these tickets will have two roles:

* enable a session resumption with the Fronting Service for the purpose
  of tunnel establishment;

* and, enable an end to end session resumption with the Hidden
  Service.

The broad lines of the design could be follow:

  * the hidden server and the fronting server share a symmetric key
    K_sni.

  * the client connects to the hidden server directly and the
    hidden server supplies:

       (i) a ticket which consists of
~~~
           AEAD(K_s, <ordinary-ticket> || <id-hidden-service>)
~~~
       (ii) the identity of the fronting server (in some header)

  * When the client reconnects to the fronting server, it decrypts
    the ticket using K_sni and if it succeeds, then it just forwards
    the CH to the hidden server indicated in id-hidden-service
    (which of course has to know to ignore SNI).
    Otherwise, it terminates the connection itself with its own
    SNI.

  * Note that the hidden server can just refresh the ticket any time
    it pleases, as usual.

(TODO: document how exactly that can work)

(TODO: do we need a specific extension to the TLS 1.3 protocol)

## First session

The previous sections present how sessions can be resumed with the combined
ticket. However, there needs to be a first connection to the hidden
service. The following are plausible:

1- The client directly connects to the Hidden Service, and then asks
   for a combined ticket. The SNI will not be encrypted for this
   first connection, but it may be encryptedin subsequent connections.

2- The client learns about the relation between Fronting Service and
   Hidden Service through an out of band channel. It established
   a regular connection to the Fronting Service, and from there
   requests a combined ticket.

The plausible out of band channels are the DNS, and word of mouth.

# Security Considerations {#secusec}

The encapsulation protocol proposed in this draft mitigates the known attacks
listed in (#snisecreq). For example, the encapsulation design uses pairwise
security contexts, and is not dependent on the widely chaired secrets described
in (#sharedsecrets). The design also does not rely on additional public key
operations by the multiplexed server or by the fronting server, and thus does
not open the attck surface for  denial of service discussed in (#serveroverload).
The session keys are negotiated end to end between the client and the
protected service, as required in (#nocontextsharing).

However, in some cases, proper mitigation depends on careful implementation.

## Replay attacks and side channels {#sidechannels}

The solution mitigates the replay attacks described in (#replayattack)
because adversaries cannot receive the replies intended
for the client. However, the connection from the
fronting service to the hidden service can be observed through
side channels.

To give an obvious example, suppose that
the fronting service merely relays the data
by establishing a TCP connection to the hidden service. Adversaries
can associate the arrival of an encrypted message to the fronting
service and the setting of a connection to the hidden service, and deduce
which hidden service the user accessed.

The mitigation of this attack relies on proper implementation
of the fronting service. (TODO: Yeah, right. In other news, free beer tomorrow.)

## Sticking out

The TLS encapsulation protocol mostly fulfills the requirements to "not
stick out" expressed in (#snireqdontstickout).
The initial messages will be sent as 0-RTT data, and will be encrypted using
the 0-RTT key negotiated with the fronting service. Adversaries cannot
tell whether the client is using TLS encapsulation or some other
0-RTT service. However, this is only true if the fronting service
regularly uses 0-RTT data.

## Forward Secrecy

In the TLS encapsulation protocol, the encapsulated Client Hello is encrypted
using the session resumption key. If this key is revealed, the Client Hello data
will also be revealed. The mitigation there is to not use the same session resumption
key multiple time.

The most common implementations of TLS tickets have the server using Session Ticket
Encryption Keys (STEKs) to create an encrypted copy of the session parameters
which is then stored by the client. When the client resumes, it supplies this
encrypted copy, the server decrypts it, and has the parameters it needs to resume.
The server need only remember the STEK. If a STEK is disclosed to an adversary, then all
of the data encrypted by sessions protected by the STEK may be decrypted by an adversary.

To mitigate this attack, server implementations of the TLS encapsulation protocol
SHOULD NOT use STEK protected TLS tickets. (TODO: and something more...)

# IANA Considerations

Do we need to register an extension point? Or is it just OK to
use early data?

https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/tXvdcqnogZgqmdfCugrV8M90Ftw.

During the discussion of SNI Encryption in Yokohama, Deb Cooley
argued that rather than messing with TLS to allow SNI encryption,
we should just tunnel TLS in TLS. A number of people objected
to this on the grounds of the performance cost for the gateway
because it has to encrypt and decrypt everything.

After the meeting, Martin Thomson suggested a modification to the
tunnelling proposal that removes this cost. The key observation is
that if we think of the 0-RTT flight as a separate message attached to
the handshake, then we can tunnel a second first flight in it.
